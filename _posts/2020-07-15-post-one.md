This was the final task in my DOT CAMPUS learning board and i thought it befitting to make it my first learning blog post, as i will be recaping my various concluded projects, excersices and tasks in my aim to become a Data Analyst.

I used jupyter notebook and resources from cousera to scrape a website that compares the salary of three basketball players using pythons beautifulsoup library. It's used for pulling data out of HTML and XML files into a jupyter notebook.

{% highlight ruby %}
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
{% endhighlight %}

Performing Web Scraping involves getting familiar with some html concepts like Prettify, Tag, Parents, Children and Siblings, but not to much just enough to get the task done. I already covered Web Scraping in an earlier module and its always interesting watching the Beautiful soup magic in action.

Beautiful soup converts the html table into a Data Frame and then that Data Frame gets converted into a csv file. Awesome! This csv file can now be used in your analysis on python or any other platform, in anyway you choose.

{% highlight ruby %}
pd.read_html(str(tables[5]), flavor='lxml')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
df.to_csv('10_most_densly_populated_countries.csv',index=False)
{% endhighlight %}

Next on the task was performing a series of excersises on stock data retrievals using 'yfinance' another powerful python library used for extracting financial data for Analysis. Here i used yfinance to extract Apple stock data and perform some series of objectives like getting information about the stock,

{% highlight ruby %}
import json
with open('apple.json') as json_file:
    apple_info = json.load(json_file)
{% endhighlight %}

share prices over a period of time,

{% highlight ruby %}
apple_share_price_data = apple.history(period="max")
{% endhighlight %}

and then did some visualizations.

Thanks to Dot Campus i have gained these valuable skills and can now use python and jupyter notebook in Data Analysis proficiently.
