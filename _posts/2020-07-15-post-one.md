This was the final task in my DOT CAMPUS learning board and i thought it befittin to make it myfirst learning blog post, as i will be recapping my various projects, excersices and tasks in my aim to become a Data Analyst.

I used jupyter notebook and resources from cousera to scrape a website that compares the salary of three basketball players using pythons beautifulsoup library used for pulling data out of HTML and XML files

{% highlight ruby %}
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
{% endhighlight %}

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
