This analysis explored various Inferential Statistical methods for Analysis such as Hypothesis testing using t-tests and ANOVA, Correlation analysis using Pearsons correlation and also Regression Analysis to seek out relationships between variables and highlight some key insights in the dataset.

The purpose of these exercise was to serve as assessment to measure my grasp of using various statistical methods in data analysis. The boston dataset consisted of a fully numerical data which is best suited for statistical analysis, i ofcourse had to visualise some important key components of a few variables in order to observe some trends or relationships between them.

For instance creating a Boxplot for the Median Value of Owner Occupied Homes (MEDV) Column to tell if there exists any outliers in the data. Ths presence of the seen outliers suggested variability in housing prices due to possibly location,size and House condition
