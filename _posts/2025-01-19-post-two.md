This analysis explored various Inferential Statistical methods for Analysis such as Hypothesis testing using t-tests and ANOVA, Correlation analysis using Pearsons correlation and also Regression Analysis to seek out relationships between variables and highlight some key insights in the dataset.

The purpose of these exercise was to serve as assessment to measure my grasp of using various statistical methods in data analysis. The boston dataset consisted of a fully numerical data which is best suited for statistical analysis, i also had to visualise some important key components of a few variables in order to observe some trends or relationships between them.

For instance creating a Boxplot for the Median Value of Owner Occupied Homes (MEDV) Column to tell if there exists any outliers in the data. Ths presence of the seen outliers suggested variability in housing prices due to possibly location,size and House condition

 A Bar plot for the charles river variable showing the distribution of houses in proximity to the charles river, another Boxplot showing  MEDV (Median value of owner occupied homes) against newly created AGE(Proportion of owner occupied units built before 1940) groups, and  A Scatter Plot showing the Relationship between Nitrate Oxide Concentrations (NOX) and Proportion of Non retail Business Acres per Town(INDUS)and a few other more vissualizations to bring the data to a clearer light.
 I then procceded to conduct a series of Statistical tests to  eplore this data set and revealhidden insights as wellas define various relationships between key variables among these were 
 
A T- Test

An ANOVA

A Pearson'sCorrelation

and a Regression Analysis.
